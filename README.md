# Binary Calculator


        The Binary Calculator allows the user to input two binary numbers into the function, while also letting them choose the the operator as well. The Calculator will change both binary numbers into decimal numbers, add/subtract/divide/multiply them together, and convert it back into a binary number. The calculator and also figure out if the numbers would overflow the binary, or if the binary number is not all digits (ex. 10akd1), or if the you are dividing by zero which it will give you 'Error' 

    Plug ins:
        bin1: The first binary number as a string (it should only have 0s and 1s).
        bin2: The second binary number as a string (it should only have 0s and 1s).
        operator: The math symbol ('+', '-', '*', '/').

    Example:
        For example, if I plug in 1010 (10), 0110 (6), and "-", the code should convert the first binary to 10, second binary to 6, and subtract the two, it would get 4. Then it would translate it back into binary in 8-bit (00000100).
